            <h2> Games </h2>
            As my friend Deckard Cain here will tell you, I'm an avid gamer
            (when I have the time). My all-time favourite game has to be Diablo
            2 (although I really enjoyed the most recent God of War too). I'm
            currently getting through a bunch of nasties in The Last of Us 2.

            <h2> Sci-Fi</h2>
            It's pretty much all I read. I highly recommend the Hyperion Cantos
            by Dan Simmons, or the Expanse series by James S. A. Corey (which is
            also a very good tv series out at the moment).
            <br />
            I've been fascinated by all things space since a young age, and I'd
            like to think that I'd make a great astronaut or space cowboy.

            <h2> Pottery </h2>
            Up until recently I was a member of a ceramic studio and enjoyed
            producing a wide variety of ceramic beauties (but mostly mugs). I
            hope to pick this up again soon so that I don't have buy anyone
            presents anymore.

            This is my cat, Marbles. She's a delightfully spicy beanbag who
            loves to chew plastic under the bed at 4 in the morning.
